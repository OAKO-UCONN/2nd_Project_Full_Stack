# Dine-Now!

This Project is called Dine-Now! Dine-Now was made to help people connect and find restaurants with available tables. It was also made for restuarant managers so they can manage their tables and time limits if they have limited seating. This is especially useful during covid as there are "gap-tables" for social distancing and outdoor dining only in many restaurants.
