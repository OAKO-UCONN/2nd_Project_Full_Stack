# 2nd_Project_Full_Stack

This Project is called Dine-Now! Dine-Now was made to help people connect and find restaurants with available tables. It was also made for restuarant managers so they can manage their tables and time limits if they have limited seating.

This is a node.js application. To start clone the repository. Once cloned make sure you have VsCodium or VsCode. I prefer VsCodium because its the Free Open Source version of VsCode without telemetry. Now that you have VsCodium or VsCode installed open the terminal and run "npm -i" this command will initialize your packages. Once your packages are installed run in the same terminal "node server.js" It will tell you the port number. Go to your browser and type "http://localhost:portnumber" replace portnumber with the port number that the node.js terminal set it as. Now the application is running!

This Project connects to Heroku and uses an SQL Database. To view the Database download and Install MySQL Workbench.

# Getting Started with DineNow

TESTING HEROKU PUSH

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
